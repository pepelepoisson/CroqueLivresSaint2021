This repo contains files about a project called GeaiRareLit. It is all about building a small ESP8266 brain for a little bookcase installed outside of my local school. The device is solar powered and drives WS2812B leds + epaper when door is opened. ePaper is used to display an inspiring sentence from a famous author. Users passing by the bookself get the chance to read the sentence even tough they have no book to give or take. All project details are available on the [project page](http://www.chezpapietmamie.com/pcube/uncategorized/geairarelit/)
